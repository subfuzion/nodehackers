## Accessing Presentations

The presentations are in README.md files and can be read directly or they can be viewed using **[revealme](https://github.com/yanatan16/revealme)**, a hosted, open source, presentation viewer based on [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). 

For example, the February, 2014, presentation can be viewed by adding the repo path (including branch) to the revealme app on Heroku:
