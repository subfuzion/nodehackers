Introduction
------------

No long-winded intro:

 * This will be a whirlwind introduction to the Node stack -- we'll dive right in
 * I'll explain why Node is interesting and relevant as we go
 * I'll talk about Node's background and why it's future is so exciting AFTERWARDS -- ***if you liked what you saw, you'll want to stick around***

Setting Up a Node Dev Environment
---------------------------------

Lots of options

 * Download an installer from http://nodejs.org/
 * Build from source: https://github.com/joyent/node
 * Use a cloud development environment
    * Cloud9 (https://c9.io/)
    * Nitrous (https://www.nitrous.io/)

*For this presentation, I'll use*  ***Cloud9***  *to make it easy for everyone to follow*
